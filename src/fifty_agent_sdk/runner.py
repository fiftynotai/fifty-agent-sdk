"""AgentRunner — the user-facing orchestrator.

:class:`AgentRunner` is the SDK's top-level entry point for running an
agent across multiple conversational turns. It wraps an
:class:`fifty_agent_sdk.loop.AgentLoop` with conversation-state persistence
around each ``run()`` call:

1. Load prior messages from a :class:`fifty_agent_sdk.state.protocol.StateStore`.
2. Persist any first-turn ``system_prompt`` and the user's new message
   BEFORE driving the loop (durable proof of request).
3. Drive :meth:`AgentLoop.run` and forward every
   :class:`fifty_agent_sdk.streaming.AgentEvent` to the caller.
4. Persist the assistant's final answer ONLY on a clean
   :class:`fifty_agent_sdk.streaming.FinalEvent` with no preceding
   :class:`fifty_agent_sdk.streaming.ErrorEvent`.

System prompt vs. AgentLoop's structured prompt
    :class:`AgentLoop`'s ``prompts: PromptSections`` is the SDK-structured
    prompt rebuilt on every iteration from a tool-registry snapshot. It is
    NEVER persisted — it lives inside the loop's private working list and
    is the model's per-iteration reasoning scaffolding.

    :class:`AgentRunner`'s ``system_prompt: str | None`` is an OPTIONAL
    consumer-supplied kickoff message that, when set, is persisted as
    the first :class:`fifty_agent_sdk.llm.types.ChatMessage` with
    ``role="system"`` on the FIRST turn of a session only. It is the
    high-level instruction the consumer wants to ride alongside the
    SDK's structured prompt (for example, "You are a helpful
    customer-support agent"). Both coexist in the loop's prompt; that
    is intentional and supported by every major LLM provider.

Transactional persistence invariants
    * Every successful ``run()`` appends exactly one user message and
      exactly one assistant message to the state store. If
      ``system_prompt`` was set and the session was empty, exactly one
      :class:`ChatMessage` with ``role="system"`` is also appended,
      BEFORE the user message.
    * On any error during loop execution (LLMError, ParserError,
      iteration cap), the assistant message is NOT persisted; the user
      message remains durable. The fallback final answer is yielded to
      the caller but not committed to history.
    * On consumer cancellation, the assistant message is NOT persisted;
      the user message remains durable.
    * Tool roundtrips (``role="tool"`` messages) are NOT persisted to the
      state store. They live in the loop's private working list and are
      deterministically re-derivable from the assistant's final answer
      on the next turn. Tool-level provenance is instead captured through
      the optional :class:`fifty_agent_sdk.audit.protocol.AuditSink` (see below).
      The same holds for an ``after_tool`` note or a ``before_tool`` denial
      text (FR-003): it is part of that call's observation for the rest of
      the run and is never persisted, in any tool-result role.

Audit emission
    When an optional :class:`fifty_agent_sdk.audit.protocol.AuditSink` is wired
    in, the Runner emits an :class:`fifty_agent_sdk.audit.protocol.AuditEvent` at
    four points of every ``run()``: session start, each tool invocation
    (argument metadata — sorted keys with per-value type names and lengths,
    never the values — plus a bounded result summary), the final answer,
    and any error.

    Audit emission is best-effort and isolated from the run: a raising
    sink is caught by :meth:`_emit_audit`, logged at ``WARNING`` under the
    ``fifty_agent_sdk.audit`` logger (event ``audit.emit_failed``), and
    swallowed — a sink outage NEVER aborts a live run.
    :class:`asyncio.CancelledError` is the one exception that is re-raised
    untouched. When ``audit`` is ``None`` (the default) emission is
    zero-overhead: :meth:`_emit_audit` returns before constructing any
    :class:`AuditEvent`.

Observability hooks
    When an optional :class:`fifty_agent_sdk.observability.Hooks` is wired in,
    the Runner fires five of the seven hooks: ``on_run_start`` once at run
    start, ``on_tool_start`` / ``on_tool_end`` per tool invocation,
    ``on_error`` on a loop-internal, durability, or fatal-SDK-error
    failure, and ``on_run_end`` once from the ``finally`` block on EVERY
    exit path. The remaining two hooks
    (``on_iteration``, ``on_llm_call``) are Loop-tier — the consumer must
    wire the SAME :class:`Hooks` instance into :class:`fifty_agent_sdk.loop.
    AgentLoop` as well. The Runner does NOT forward ``hooks`` into the loop;
    the two collaborators are wired independently, exactly like ``audit``.

    Hook dispatch is best-effort and isolated, mirroring audit emission: a
    raising hook is caught, logged at ``WARNING`` under the
    ``fifty_agent_sdk.observability`` logger (event ``hook.invoke_failed``), and
    swallowed — including ``on_run_end`` raising inside ``finally``, where
    the swallow guarantee is what makes awaiting a hook there safe.
    :class:`asyncio.CancelledError` is re-raised untouched. When ``hooks``
    is ``None`` (the default) dispatch is zero-overhead.

Interventions
    The value-honouring hooks of :class:`fifty_agent_sdk.interventions.
    Interventions` (FR-003) are wired on :class:`fifty_agent_sdk.loop.
    AgentLoop` only; the Runner takes none. It already passes its
    ``session_id`` into :meth:`AgentLoop.run`, which forwards it to
    ``before_tool`` and ``after_tool``. A call that ``before_tool`` denies
    still emits ``ActionEvent``, ``ToolStartedEvent`` and a terminal
    ``ToolFailedEvent``, so the per-call correlation below (args claimed FIFO
    per ``ToolStartedEvent``) holds unchanged, and a ``ReplaceToolArgs``
    replacement is what ``on_tool_start`` and the ``tool_invocation`` audit
    payload see, because both read ``ActionEvent.args``.

Logging
    Module-level :mod:`structlog` logger. ``INFO`` on run start and run
    end; ``ERROR`` only when persistence itself fails. Never logs prompt
    or message content — only lengths and counts.

    The ``runner.run_completed`` log carries ``terminated_by`` with one of:

    * ``"final_answer"`` — happy path: a clean :class:`FinalEvent` was
      yielded and the assistant message was persisted.
    * ``"error"`` — loop-internal failure (LLMError, ParserError,
      MaxIterationsExceeded). The loop's fallback FinalEvent is yielded
      but the assistant message is NOT persisted.
    * ``"state_store_error"`` — durability boundary failed. A
      :class:`fifty_agent_sdk.errors.StateStoreError` propagated out of one of
      the load/append calls. A companion ``phase`` field names which
      site failed: ``"load"``, ``"persist_system"``, ``"persist_user"``,
      or ``"persist_assistant"``.
    * ``"cancelled"`` — the consumer task was cancelled while the run was
      in flight; :class:`asyncio.CancelledError` propagates untouched.
    * ``"interrupted"`` — fallback for every other exit path not
      attributable to the categories above: an unexpected non-SDK
      exception escaping the loop, or the consumer breaking out of the
      ``async for`` / closing the generator via ``aclose()`` (which
      surfaces as :class:`GeneratorExit`, not cancellation).
    * ``"sdk_error"`` — a fatal :class:`fifty_agent_sdk.errors.AgentSdkError`
      subclass escaped the loop as an exception (for example an
      :class:`~fifty_agent_sdk.errors.MCPError` re-raised by the tool
      registry). The Runner audits the error, fires ``on_error``, passes
      the exception to ``on_run_end``, and re-raises it.

        state: Any :class:`StateStore` implementation. Use
            :class:`MemoryStateStore` for ephemeral in-memory storage;
            BR-009/BR-010 ship durable backends.
        system_prompt: Optional consumer-supplied kickoff persisted as the
            FIRST :class:`ChatMessage` with ``role="system"`` on the first
            turn of each fresh session. When ``None`` (default), no system

            between this and ``AgentLoop.prompts``.
        audit: Optional :class:`fifty_agent_sdk.audit.protocol.AuditSink`. When

            :class:`fifty_agent_sdk.audit.protocol.AuditEvent` on session start,

            "Audit emission" section. When ``None`` (default), emission is

            ``on_run_end``, ``on_tool_start``, ``on_tool_end``,
            ``on_error``). The two Loop-tier hooks (``on_iteration``,

            dispatch is zero-overhead.

    Invariants:
        * Every ``run()`` either persists exactly one user message and
          exactly one assistant message, OR persists only the user
          message (on error or cancellation).
        * The optional ``system_prompt`` is persisted at most ONCE per
          session — only on the first ``run()`` call for that session.
        * Tool roundtrips are NOT persisted to state; the loop's working
          list carries them. Tool-level provenance is captured through the
          optional ``audit`` sink instead. Intervention text (an
          ``after_tool`` note, a ``before_tool`` denial; FR-003) is part of
          those roundtrips and is never persisted either.
        * Audit emission is best-effort and isolated: a raising
          :class:`AuditSink` is caught and logged, never propagated. With
          ``audit=None`` the run behaves identically to a Runner built
          without auditing — no events, no overhead.

          raising hook is caught and logged, never propagated. With
          ``hooks=None`` the run behaves identically to a Runner built
          without hooks — no dispatch, no overhead.
        * A Runner-level ``run_id`` is generated per ``run()`` call for
          log correlation and is SEPARATE from the inner :class:`AgentLoop`
          run id. Neither id is exposed on :class:`AgentEvent` values.
        * The :class:`StateStore` passed as ``state`` is retrievable by
          identity through the read-only :attr:`state` property and is
          FIXED for the Runner's lifetime — the store this Runner reads

        so a large or binary result cannot bloat the audit row.

        ``args`` is NEVER embedded verbatim: argument values routinely carry
        secrets and PII, and the payload is persisted and logged as-is, so
        the payload's ``"args"`` field is the non-content summary built by
        :func:`_args_metadata` (sorted keys, per-value type names and
        lengths — never values).

        Args:
            event: The :class:`ObservationEvent` or :class:`ToolFailedEvent`
                that ended the tool call.
            args: The tool's argument dict, correlated per call; ``{}``
                when no :class:`ActionEvent` could be claimed for the call.
            pending_call: The correlated :class:`ToolStartedEvent`, if seen.

        Returns:
            The structured ``payload`` dict for the audit event.

        """Drive a single conversational turn for ``session_id``.

        Algorithm (full edge-case detail in the module docstring):

        1. Load prior messages from the state store.
        2. If the session is empty AND ``system_prompt`` is set, append the
           system message to state BEFORE the user message.
        3. Append the user message to state BEFORE driving the loop. This
           is the load-bearing transactional property — if the loop
           later fails the user message remains durable.
        4. Drive :meth:`AgentLoop.run` with the loaded-plus-user
           conversation. Forward every event to the caller unchanged.
        5. If the run terminates with a :class:`FinalEvent` and no
           preceding :class:`ErrorEvent`, append the assistant message
           to state. The runner persists the raw LLM completion when the
           loop supplies it (the happy-path :class:`FinalAnswer` branch
           sets :attr:`FinalEvent.raw_completion`), falling back to the
           parsed text on the safety paths. Otherwise skip — the
           fallback final answer is yielded but not committed.

        On consumer cancellation (the consumer task is cancelled):
        :class:`asyncio.CancelledError` propagates untouched. The user
        message persisted in step 3 survives; no assistant message is
        persisted.

        On a fatal :class:`fifty_agent_sdk.errors.AgentSdkError` escaping the
        loop (for example an :class:`~fifty_agent_sdk.errors.MCPError`
        re-raised by the tool registry — :meth:`AgentLoop.run` documents
        that non-recoverable SDK errors propagate): the Runner emits the
        ``error`` audit event, fires ``on_error`` with the exception,
        records it for ``on_run_end``, sets ``terminated_by="sdk_error"``,
        and re-raises so the exception still reaches the caller. No
        assistant message is persisted.

        On :class:`fifty_agent_sdk.errors.StateStoreError` raised by the state
        store: the error is logged at ``ERROR`` and re-raised. The Runner
        does NOT swallow state-store failures — the caller decides retry
        policy.

        Args:
            session_id: Opaque session identifier.
            user_message: The new user message text.

        Yields:
            :class:`AgentEvent` values forwarded from the inner
            :class:`AgentLoop` in monotonic ``sequence`` order. On a clean
            or loop-internal-failure termination the terminal event is a
            :class:`FinalEvent`; a fatal :class:`AgentSdkError` escaping the
            loop ends the stream by raising instead.

        Raises:
            fifty_agent_sdk.errors.StateStoreError: If any state-store
                operation fails. The error is logged before being
                re-raised.
            fifty_agent_sdk.errors.AgentSdkError: Any fatal SDK error the
                loop lets propagate. It is audited, reported to
                ``on_error``, and passed to ``on_run_end`` before being
                re-raised.
            asyncio.CancelledError: Propagated untouched from the loop
                or from the consumer's cancellation.

                block for any run that passed the load gate — every exit
                path, success or failure. Payload: ``session_id``,

                ``assistant_message_persisted``, ``event_count``,

                ``"state_store_error"``, ``"cancelled"``, or
                ``"interrupted"`` (see the module docstring).
            ``runner.persist_failed`` (ERROR): Emitted at each of the four
                state-store boundaries — load, system-prompt persist, user
                persist, assistant persist — when the underlying
                :class:`fifty_agent_sdk.errors.StateStoreError` is raised.
                Payload: ``phase`` (one of ``"load"``,

                ``"persist_assistant"``), ``session_id``, ``run_id``,
                ``error_type``, ``error_message``. When the load phase

                the only log emitted — no ``runner.run_completed`` follows,
