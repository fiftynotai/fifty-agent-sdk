These models are the *provider-agnostic surface* of the SDK. Every

    Attributes:

        temperature: Sampling temperature in ``[0.0, 2.0]``. Default ``0.0``.
            Set to ``None`` to OMIT the parameter from the request body
            entirely — for providers/models (e.g. OpenAI's reasoning-model
            family) that reject a non-default temperature. The default is
            ``0.0`` (NOT ``None``) so existing callers' wire behavior is
            unchanged: the key is sent unless explicitly set to ``None``.
        max_tokens: Optional cap on completion tokens. Must be ``>= 1`` if set.
            :class:`~fifty_agent_sdk.llm.openai_compat.OpenAICompatibleClient`
            sends it as ``max_completion_tokens`` for models that reject
            ``max_tokens`` (see its ``max_tokens_param`` option).
        response_format: Optional provider-format hint. Common values are
            ``{"type": "json_object"}`` or ``{"type": "text"}``. Adapters
            pass this through verbatim where supported.
        tools: Optional OpenAI-style tool-declaration envelope for native
            (provider-structured) function-calling. Each entry has the shape
            ``{"type": "function", "function": {"name", "description",
            "parameters": {...JSON Schema...}}}``. When set, the adapter
            declares the tools to the provider via the ``tools`` request param
            so the model may return native ``tool_calls``. ``None`` (the
            default) means NO tools are declared and the request wire is
            byte-for-byte the pre-BR-008 shape.
        tool_choice: Optional steering for native tool-calling when
            :attr:`tools` is set. Accepts a mode string — ``"auto"`` (the
            default the adapter emits when this is ``None``),
            ``"required"``, or ``"none"`` — or a :class:`ToolChoiceFunction`
            object ``{"type": "function", "function": {"name": ...}}`` that
            forces the model to call the named function. Ignored when
            :attr:`tools` is ``None``.
        reasoning_effort: Optional provider reasoning level for reasoning
            models (FR-002), for example ``"none"``, ``"minimal"``, ``"low"``,
            ``"medium"``, ``"high"`` or ``"xhigh"``. Which levels a model
            accepts is up to the provider. ``None`` (the default) omits it:
            the adapter adds no key, so the request body has the same keys,
            values and JSON types as in 1.8.0. The STRING ``"none"`` is a
            real provider level and IS sent.
            When set, :class:`~fifty_agent_sdk.llm.openai_compat.
            OpenAICompatibleClient` sends it verbatim as a top-level
            ``reasoning_effort`` for every model: there is no model-name
            filter, so a provider or model that rejects it returns an error,
            raised as :class:`~fifty_agent_sdk.errors.LLMError`. The value
            must be a lowercase token (``^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]*$``); anything else
            fails validation at construction. A custom
            :class:`~fifty_agent_sdk.llm.protocol.LLMClient` receives the
