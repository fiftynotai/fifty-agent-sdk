class OpenAICompatibleClient:
    """:class:`LLMClient` implementation backed by the ``openai`` Python SDK.

    Works against any OpenAI-compatible ``/v1/chat/completions`` endpoint.
    Provider variation is absorbed by ``base_url`` — the same client class
    drives OpenAI itself, GDC, and local OSS servers.

    Async context management
        The client is an async context manager: ``async with
        OpenAICompatibleClient(...) as client:`` closes the underlying
        connection pool on exit via :meth:`aclose`. Without the context
        manager, call :meth:`aclose` explicitly — an unclosed client leaks
        its ``httpx.AsyncClient`` pool until GC.

    Args:
        api_key: API key passed to the upstream provider. Required even for
            local servers that ignore it; pass any non-empty string.
        base_url: Override the default OpenAI base URL. Use for GDC or a
            self-hosted endpoint. ``None`` means use the SDK default.
        model: Default model identifier used when a :class:`ChatRequest` does
            not set one. ``None`` means callers MUST set ``request.model``.
        timeout: Per-request timeout in seconds. Defaults to ``60.0``.
        max_retries: SDK-level retry count for transient failures (429, 5xx,
            connection errors). Defaults to ``2``. Set to ``0`` to make
            errors surface immediately, which is what tests want.
        http_client: Optional pre-configured ``httpx.AsyncClient``. Useful for
            tests that need to inject a mock transport. When omitted, the
            SDK builds its own client, OWNS it, and closes it on
            :meth:`aclose`. An INJECTED client is NOT closed by
            :meth:`aclose` — its lifecycle belongs to the caller. This
            owned-vs-injected discipline mirrors
            :class:`fifty_agent_sdk.mcp.client.MCPClient`.
        max_tokens_param: Which request-body key carries
            :attr:`ChatRequest.max_tokens`. ``None`` (the default) picks per
            request from the model name: ``"max_completion_tokens"`` for
            OpenAI reasoning-model families (``o1`` / ``o3`` / ``o4`` /
            ``gpt-5*``, which reject ``max_tokens``), ``"max_tokens"`` for
            everything else. Set it explicitly when the model name does not
            reveal the family — e.g. an Azure deployment name — or to force
            ``"max_tokens"`` for a server that does not understand
            ``max_completion_tokens``. Has no effect when ``max_tokens`` is
            unset. On reasoning models the cap includes reasoning tokens, so
            a small cap can exhaust the budget before any visible output.

        For every message EXCEPT an assistant turn carrying native
        ``tool_calls``, this is byte-for-byte ``msg.model_dump(exclude_none=True)``
        (the pre-BR-008 behavior). For an assistant turn carrying
        ``tool_calls`` (only set when native function-calling is on), the
        message is translated into the OpenAI envelope:

            {role:"assistant", content, tool_calls: [

        The ``id`` is sourced PER ENTRY from the entry's own
        :attr:`~fifty_agent_sdk.llm.types.ToolCall.id` (BR-006): the loop
        mints a distinct id per dispatched call so a multi-call assistant
        turn carries N DISTINCT ids, and each subsequent ``role="tool"``
        reply pairs with exactly one entry (a strict OpenAI endpoint returns
        400 otherwise). The fallback
        ``tc.id if tc.id is not None else msg.tool_call_id`` preserves the
        BR-008 single-call wire byte-for-byte: the single-call native path
        sets ``ToolCall(id=None)`` and ``msg.tool_call_id=call_id``, so
        ``tc.id is None`` falls back to ``msg.tool_call_id`` and emits the
        same id BR-008 did. ``arguments`` is emitted as a JSON STRING (not an
        object), per the OpenAI function-calling spec.

        Flag-OFF proof: ``ChatMessage.tool_calls`` defaults to ``None`` and is
        only populated on a native turn (which requires
        ``native_tools_enabled=True`` to even reach the provider), so every
