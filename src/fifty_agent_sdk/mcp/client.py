"""MCP client wrapping the official :mod:`mcp` Python SDK.

:class:`MCPClient` is a thin wrapper around the official ``mcp`` SDK's
:class:`mcp.ClientSession` over Streamable HTTP. The JSON-RPC wire, envelope
correlation, session-id handling, and protocol handshake are owned by
``mcp`` (pinned ``mcp>=1.27.0,<2.0.0``); this module is responsible only for
the fifty-agent-sdk-facing contract: typed :class:`MCPToolDef`s out of
``tools/list``, the unwrapped tool payload out of ``tools/call``, the uniform
:class:`fifty_agent_sdk.errors.MCPError` translation, and auth-header redaction.

Transport
    The protocol/transport machinery lives behind a
    :class:`fifty_agent_sdk.mcp.transport.Transport`. The default
    :class:`fifty_agent_sdk.mcp.transport.StreamableHttpTransport` establishes the
    Streamable HTTP stream pair and yields an already-``initialize()``d
    session. A future stdio transport implements the same seam without any
    change to :class:`MCPClient` or its consumers.

Session lifecycle — session-per-call
    Each :meth:`discover`/:meth:`invoke` opens a fresh session
    (``initialize`` → call → close). This preserves the original "no
    persistent connection" mental model, keeps :meth:`aclose` trivial, and
    lets callable ``auth`` resolve fresh per call (token rotation). A
    lazy-persistent single-session optimization is a deferred follow-up.

Authentication
    The constructor accepts an ``auth`` argument that is either a static
    ``Mapping[str, str]`` (e.g. ``{"Authorization": "Bearer ..."}``) or an
    async callable returning the same shape on each invocation. Callables
    enable token rotation without re-creating the client. In ``mcp 1.27.0``
    the supported auth/header seam is the injected :class:`httpx.AsyncClient`
    (transport-level ``headers=/auth=`` are deprecated and ignored), so
    resolved auth headers are merged onto the httpx client inside the
    transport. Auth header values are NEVER logged and NEVER appear in
    :class:`fifty_agent_sdk.errors.MCPError` context — header names registered
    through ``auth`` are tracked and redacted via :func:`_redact_headers`
    before any header dict is ever captured.

Retry policy
    ``connect_retries`` is forwarded to the owned httpx transport
    (``httpx.AsyncHTTPTransport(retries=...)``) as a connect-level retry.
    When an external ``client`` is injected this is a documented no-op (the
    injected client's transport governs). Application-level 5xx retry is out
    of scope — those surface as :class:`MCPError`.

Timeouts
    ``connect_timeout_seconds`` and ``read_timeout_seconds`` map to the owned
    httpx :class:`httpx.Timeout` and the session ``read_timeout_seconds``. A
    timeout surfaces as :class:`MCPError` with ``context["wrapped"]`` set to
    the httpx timeout class name.

Error contract
    Every public method either returns successfully or raises
    :class:`MCPError`. No ``mcp`` SDK exceptions (``McpError``) and no
    ``httpx`` exceptions leak — they are unwrapped from anyio
    ``ExceptionGroup``s and translated into :class:`MCPError`. The
    :class:`fifty_agent_sdk.tools.mcp_provider._MCPToolAdapter` deliberately does
    NOT catch :class:`MCPError` so the
    :class:`fifty_agent_sdk.tools.registry.Registry`'s ``AgentSdkError`` branch
    re-raises it untouched.

Error-content transformation seam (BR-010)
    An MCP server's ``isError`` payload is upstream-controlled prose. A
    consumer running against an untrusted or semi-trusted server needs to
    screen, redact, or reshape that text *before* it reaches the model. The
    supported, public seam is the keyword-only ``on_tool_error`` callback on
    :class:`MCPClient` — see :data:`MCPToolErrorHook` and the ``Args:`` entry on
    :class:`MCPClient`. It fires ONLY on a per-call ``isError=True`` outcome
    (never on success, and structurally never on a transport/protocol/session
    failure, which raises :class:`MCPError` at the ``call_tool`` boundary
    *before* the unwrap), and it can change only the bounded ``message``
    string — never ``is_error``, never ``output``, never the recoverable/fatal
    classification. Leaving it unset (the default) is byte-for-byte the
    pre-BR-010 behaviour: the ``None`` check short-circuits before the hook is
    called, inspected, or any new carrier is constructed.

    Reaching into the private :class:`_MCPCallError` / overriding
    :meth:`MCPClient._unwrap_invoke_result` is NOT supported; those symbols
    carry no semver protection. Use ``on_tool_error``.

    session.

    Invariant — auth headers MUST NEVER appear in MCPError.context.
        Every :class:`MCPError` raised by this client builds its
        ``context`` dict from the small allow-list ``{server_url, method,
        tool_name, wrapped, status_code, error_code, error_data,

        still tracks declared header names for any future code path that
        *does* need to surface headers (e.g. a debug-mode dump): that path

        tempted to widen the context shape: do not put headers in. Use
        :func:`_redact_headers` and prove a test exercises the redaction.

        config: Connection configuration.
        auth: Either a static header mapping (applied to every request)
            or an async callable invoked on every request (enabling
            token rotation). Header names appearing in this mapping are
            tracked as sensitive and stripped before any header dict

        client: An externally-constructed :class:`httpx.AsyncClient`.
            Provided for tests and dependency-injection scenarios; the
            client OWNS the lifecycle of internally-created clients and
            disposes them on :meth:`aclose`, but does NOT close
            externally-provided ones.
        on_tool_error: Optional :data:`MCPToolErrorHook` — the public seam for
            transforming a per-call ``isError=True`` message before it reaches
            the model (BR-010). Called positionally as
            ``on_tool_error(message, content)`` exactly once per ``isError``
            result, with the SDK's bounded default ``message`` AND the server's
            raw ``content`` blocks; its returned ``str`` replaces the message
            the :class:`fifty_agent_sdk.tools.mcp_provider._MCPToolAdapter`
            surfaces as ``ToolResult.error``. May be sync or async. The whole
            wiring is plain construction — ``MCPClient(config,
            on_tool_error=screen)`` then ``MCPProvider(client)``; no subclassing
            and no private import is needed or supported.

            **Fires ONLY on the recoverable path.** A transport, protocol, or
            session failure raises :class:`MCPError` at the ``call_tool``
            boundary, *before* the result is unwrapped, so the hook is
            structurally unreachable there (BR-005). It cannot make a fatal
            error recoverable or vice-versa.

            **What it CANNOT change:** ``is_error`` and ``output``. A replaced
            message still yields ``ToolResult(output=None, is_error=True,
            error=<replacement>)`` — a failed tool is never reported as a
            success.

            **Failure policy — on ANY failure the ORIGINAL bounded message is
            used.** A raising hook is caught, logged at ``WARNING``
            (``mcp.tool_error_hook_failed``), and the original per-call error is
            returned unchanged; the exception never propagates.
            :class:`asyncio.CancelledError` is the one exception re-raised
            untouched (consumer cancellation must propagate). A return that is
            not a ``str``, or a ``str`` that is empty/whitespace-only, is
            rejected and logged at ``WARNING``
            (``mcp.tool_error_hook_invalid``). It is structurally impossible for
            ``ToolResult.error`` to become ``None``, ``""``, or a non-string via
            this seam. This DIVERGES from
            :func:`fifty_agent_sdk.observability.hooks.invoke_hook`, which
            returns ``None`` and merely swallows: this hook must yield a value,
            so swallowing alone is not a policy.

            **Logging discipline.** The failure logs carry ``tool_name``,
            ``error_type`` / ``returned_type`` and a ``reason`` ONLY — never
            ``str(exc)``, never the ``content``, never the message text.

            **Latency.** The hook is awaited INLINE, inside the
            :class:`fifty_agent_sdk.tools.registry.Registry`'s ``tool_timeout``
            budget. Keep it fast — a slow screen eats the tool budget. It only
            ever fires on the error path, so the happy path is untouched.

            **Zero overhead when unset.** The default ``None`` short-circuits
            before the hook is called, inspected, or any new carrier is
            constructed; the hook-off path is byte-for-byte the pre-BR-010 path.

            differs from the BR-008 hand-rolled client; consumers reading
            ``ToolResult.output`` should expect ``dict`` (structured) or
            ``list[dict]`` (content blocks).

            On a per-call ``isError=True`` result, returns a
            :class:`_MCPCallError` (NOT raised — BR-005): the transport,
            protocol, and session round-trip succeeded, so the failure is a
            recoverable per-tool error the
            :class:`fifty_agent_sdk.tools.mcp_provider._MCPToolAdapter` maps to a
            :class:`fifty_agent_sdk.tools.protocol.ToolResult` with
            ``is_error=True``. When an ``on_tool_error`` hook is configured
            (BR-010) its returned string replaces that carrier's ``message``
            (``content`` is preserved unchanged); on any hook failure the
            original bounded message is used. With no hook configured the
            carrier is returned by identity, byte-for-byte as before.

        Raises:
            MCPError: For transport failure, protocol/handshake failure, or
                server-returned JSON-RPC error (all raised at the

        Reached ONLY after :meth:`mcp.ClientSession.call_tool` returned a
        ``CallToolResult`` without raising — i.e. the transport, protocol, and
        session are provably healthy. Therefore a ``result.isError`` here is
        always a recoverable *per-call* failure, never a connection failure:
        the latter is raised as :class:`MCPError` at the ``call_tool`` boundary
        (``invoke``) and never enters this function. This call-site structure —
        not field-sniffing — is the discriminator between recoverable and fatal
        MCP errors (BR-005).

        Recoverable error shape (BR-005):
            When ``result.isError`` is True, this RETURNS (does not raise) a
            :class:`_MCPCallError` carrying a bounded model-safe ``message`` and
            the server's error ``content`` blocks. The
            :class:`fifty_agent_sdk.tools.mcp_provider._MCPToolAdapter` translates

            :class:`fifty_agent_sdk.tools.protocol.ToolResult` with
            ``is_error=True``.

        Security note — error-content capture (TD-007 item 3):
            When ``isError`` is True, ``result.content`` is serialised verbatim
            onto :attr:`_MCPCallError.content`. The SDK has no way to know what
            an MCP server places in that field — a non-conformant or
            poorly-implemented server MAY echo request arguments, credentials,
            or other sensitive material into the error content, in which case
            that material surfaces in our error logs. We intentionally preserve
            the value as-is rather than redact it: the SDK does not own the
            schema, redaction would mask real debug info, and the threat model
            here is a misbehaving downstream (which we cannot fix from the
            client side). The adapter keeps this content OFF the model-facing
            observation (only the bounded ``message`` is surfaced to the model);
            consumers running against untrusted MCP servers SHOULD scrub
            :attr:`_MCPCallError.content` before logging.

            The sanctioned scrubbing point is the ``on_tool_error`` hook on
            :class:`MCPClient` (BR-010): it receives BOTH this bounded
            ``message`` and this raw ``content``, and its returned string is what
            the model sees. It is applied by :meth:`_apply_tool_error_hook` one
            frame up, in :meth:`invoke`, *after* this method returns — NOT here,
            so that a subclass override of this (private, unsupported) method
            composes with the hook rather than racing it. Overriding this method
            or importing :class:`_MCPCallError` is NOT a supported extension
            point; ``on_tool_error`` is.

        Success shape:
            Returns ``result.structuredContent`` when the server provides it
            (a JSON object), else the content blocks serialised to plain JSON
