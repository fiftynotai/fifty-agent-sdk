"""Redis implementation of :class:`StateStore` built on ``redis.asyncio``.

:class:`RedisStateStore` is the SDK's durable-but-ephemeral conversation-state
backend: it persists across process restarts (unlike
:class:`fifty_agent_sdk.state.memory.MemoryStateStore`) yet is a natural fit for a
TTL-bounded "hot session" cache rather than a system-of-record. For a true
system-of-record use the SQL backend (:class:`fifty_agent_sdk.state.sql.SqlStateStore`).

Extras requirement
    This module requires the optional ``redis`` extra::

        pip install 'fifty-agent-sdk[redis]'

    Importing :mod:`fifty_agent_sdk` itself does NOT pull redis-py. The Redis
    surface is re-exported lazily from :mod:`fifty_agent_sdk.state` and the
    package root via module-level ``__getattr__``; first access triggers
    this module's import, and a missing dependency surfaces as a clear
    :class:`ImportError` referencing the extras line above.

Key layout (BR-004 branching)
    The trunk branch reuses the bare session key, so pre-BR-004 single-list
    data IS the trunk with zero migration::

        <key_prefix><session_id>              # trunk's own message list
        <key_prefix><session_id>:branch:<id>  # a fork's own message list
        <key_prefix><session_id>:branches     # hash: branch_id -> metadata JSON
        <key_prefix><session_id>:active       # string: the active head branch id

    where ``key_prefix`` defaults to ``"fifty_agent_sdk:state:"``. Each message
    list holds JSON-encoded :class:`ChatMessage` payloads (``RPUSH`` to append,
    ``LRANGE 0 -1`` to read in append order). A branch's materialized history
    is ``parent_history[:fork_point] + own`` (see
    :meth:`RedisStateStore._materialize`); a message's materialized sequence is
    ``anchor + index``, so no sequence column is stored. Existing single-list
    sessions read as the trunk and gain the extra keys only when first forked.

TTL semantics
    When ``ttl_seconds`` is a positive integer, every state mutation re-issues
    ``EXPIRE`` across ALL of the session's keys (trunk, every fork list, the
    registry, and the active pointer) so the whole session's expiry window
    slides forward together — a "hot session stays alive" cache, and a fork's
    parent line never expires out from under it. ``append``, ``fork``,
    ``switch_branch``, and ``truncate_after`` share one optimistic transaction:
    registry, active pointer, and message lists are watched, the mutation and
    every ``EXPIRE`` execute together, and conflicts retry from a fresh snapshot
    up to a bounded limit. When ``ttl_seconds`` is ``None`` no ``EXPIRE`` is
    ever issued and the session is durable until :meth:`delete`. A non-positive
    ``ttl_seconds`` is rejected with
    :class:`ValueError` at construction: ``EXPIRE`` with ``0`` deletes a key
    immediately, so accepting it would wipe every session key on the first
    append. :meth:`get_messages` NEVER sets or refreshes a TTL —
    reading a session does not keep it alive.

Atomicity
    Every state mutation and its optional whole-session TTL refresh execute in
    one ``MULTI``/``EXEC`` transaction. Optimistic ``WATCH`` covers the branch
    registry, active pointer, and all enumerated message lists; sustained
    contention fails after three attempts through the normal
    :class:`StateStoreError` wrapping contract.

Text UTF-8 cannot encode (BR-025)
    ``ChatMessage.model_dump_json()`` raises pydantic's
    ``PydanticSerializationError`` for a surrogate code point
    (U+D800-U+DFFF) in a message's ``content``, ``name`` or
    ``tool_call_id``. That call runs before :meth:`RedisStateStore.append`'s
    error wrapping, so such a message raised out of ``append`` as it was,
    with nothing stored (measured with fakeredis on CPython 3.14.3 with
    pydantic 2.13.4, redis 8.0.0 and fakeredis 2.36.2, and with pydantic
    2.13.5, redis 8.1.0 and fakeredis 2.39.0, and on 3.13.2 and 3.11.15
    with the latter three; BR-025 evidence, P2).
    :meth:`~RedisStateStore.append` now serialises a copy whose
    ``content``, ``name`` and ``tool_call_id`` carry each surrogate code
    point as its six-character ``\\udXXX`` escape, and
    :meth:`~RedisStateStore.get_messages` returns that escaped text.
    Nothing decodes it, and it cannot be told apart from the same six
    characters typed. A message without one in those fields is serialised as
    before, by the same call on the same object; its list entry was unchanged
    for each message BR-025 compared (probe P4; one of them, with a surrogate
    code point in ``tool_calls``, raised before and after). A field holding
    something other than a ``str`` (or ``None`` in ``name`` and
    ``tool_call_id``), which a message holds only when validation was bypassed
    (``model_construct``, ``model_copy(update=...)`` or assignment after
    validation), is passed through as it is: for the values BR-025 round 2
    tried (an int, a float, ``None``, bytes, a list), ``append`` stored the
    same entry as before. Entries already stored are not changed.

    ``tool_calls`` are serialised as before. A surrogate code point in a
    tool call's name, id or argument value still raises
    ``PydanticSerializationError``, not :class:`StateStoreError`, and
    nothing is stored. One in an argument's key does not raise: pydantic
    writes it as three U+FFFD, and the message is stored with those. A
    ``session_id`` holding one still raises ``UnicodeEncodeError`` from
    :meth:`~RedisStateStore.append` and
    :meth:`~RedisStateStore.get_messages`. These were measured with the
    versions above, the same before and after BR-025. A real Redis server
    was not measured.

Error wrapping contract
    Every public method wraps :class:`redis.exceptions.RedisError` (the
    redis-py base exception class) into
    :class:`fifty_agent_sdk.errors.StateStoreError` with:

    * ``message``: ``"RedisStateStore.<operation> failed for session_id=<id>"``
    * ``context["session_id"]``: the input session id (echoed for log
      correlation)
    * ``context["wrapped"]``: the underlying exception's class name
      (e.g., ``"ConnectionError"``, ``"TimeoutError"``) — read by
      the Runner's ``runner.persist_failed`` ERROR log per TD-004
    * ``context["operation"]``: ``"get_messages"``, ``"append"``, or
      ``"delete"``
    * ``__cause__``: the original exception, via ``raise ... from exc``

    :class:`asyncio.CancelledError` propagates untouched (it is not a
    :class:`~redis.exceptions.RedisError`). Pydantic ``ValidationError`` on
    read — which would indicate a corrupt list member — is not wrapped
    either: it is a corruption signal, not a backend failure (same stance
    as the SQL backend).

Connection ownership
    The constructor accepts a connection URL string and the store creates
    and owns the underlying connection pool. :meth:`aclose` releases it;
    callers should invoke it in a ``finally`` block when done with the
    store.
