"""AgentRunner — the user-facing orchestrator.

:class:`AgentRunner` is the SDK's top-level entry point for running an
agent across multiple conversational turns. It wraps an
:class:`agent_sdk.loop.AgentLoop` with conversation-state persistence
around each ``run()`` call:

1. Load prior messages from a :class:`agent_sdk.state.protocol.StateStore`.
2. Persist any first-turn ``system_prompt`` and the user's new message
   BEFORE driving the loop (durable proof of request).
3. Drive :meth:`AgentLoop.run` and forward every
   :class:`agent_sdk.streaming.AgentEvent` to the caller.
4. Persist the assistant's final answer ONLY on a clean
   :class:`agent_sdk.streaming.FinalEvent` with no preceding
   :class:`agent_sdk.streaming.ErrorEvent`.

System prompt vs. AgentLoop's structured prompt
    :class:`AgentLoop`'s ``prompts: PromptSections`` is the SDK-structured
    prompt rebuilt on every iteration from a tool-registry snapshot. It is
    NEVER persisted — it lives inside the loop's private working list and
    is the model's per-iteration reasoning scaffolding.

    :class:`AgentRunner`'s ``system_prompt: str | None`` is an OPTIONAL
    consumer-supplied kickoff message that, when set, is persisted as
    the first :class:`agent_sdk.llm.types.ChatMessage` with
    ``role="system"`` on the FIRST turn of a session only. It is the
    high-level instruction the consumer wants to ride alongside the
    SDK's structured prompt (for example, "You are a helpful
    customer-support agent"). Both coexist in the loop's prompt; that
    is intentional and supported by every major LLM provider.

Transactional persistence invariants
    * Every successful ``run()`` appends exactly one user message and
      exactly one assistant message to the state store. If
      ``system_prompt`` was set and the session was empty, exactly one
      :class:`ChatMessage` with ``role="system"`` is also appended,
      BEFORE the user message.
    * On any error during loop execution (LLMError, ParserError,
      iteration cap), the assistant message is NOT persisted; the user
      message remains durable. The fallback final answer is yielded to
      the caller but not committed to history.
    * On consumer cancellation, the assistant message is NOT persisted;
      the user message remains durable.
    * Tool roundtrips (``role="tool"`` messages) are NOT persisted to the
      state store. They live in the loop's private working list and are
      deterministically re-derivable from the assistant's final answer
      on the next turn. Tool-level audit provenance is BR-011's
      responsibility.

Logging
    Module-level :mod:`structlog` logger. ``INFO`` on run start and run
    end; ``ERROR`` only when persistence itself fails. Never logs prompt
    or message content — only lengths and counts.

class AgentRunner:
    """User-facing orchestrator that drives an :class:`AgentLoop` with state.

    A typical end-to-end agent fits in roughly fifteen lines::

        from agent_sdk import (
            AgentLoop, AgentRunner, JsonModeParser, MemoryStateStore,
            OpenAICompatibleClient, PromptSections, Registry, SafetyConfig,
        )

        llm = OpenAICompatibleClient(...)
        registry = Registry()
        loop = AgentLoop(
            llm=llm, registry=registry, parser=JsonModeParser(),
            prompts=PromptSections(persona="You are helpful."),
            safety=SafetyConfig(), model="gpt-4o",
        )
        runner = AgentRunner(
            loop=loop, state=MemoryStateStore(),
            system_prompt="You are a helpful customer-support agent.",
        )
        async for event in runner.run("session-abc", "Hello"):
            print(event)

    Args:
        loop: The :class:`AgentLoop` instance to drive on each ``run()``
            call. The same loop is reused across turns.
        state: Any :class:`StateStore` implementation. Use
            :class:`MemoryStateStore` for ephemeral in-memory storage;
            BR-009/BR-010 ship durable backends.
        system_prompt: Optional consumer-supplied kickoff persisted as the
            FIRST :class:`ChatMessage` with ``role="system"`` on the first
            turn of each fresh session. When ``None`` (default), no system
            message is persisted; the loop's structured prompt does the
            entire job. See the module docstring for the precise boundary
            between this and ``AgentLoop.prompts``.

    Invariants:
        * Every ``run()`` either persists exactly one user message and
          exactly one assistant message, OR persists only the user
          message (on error or cancellation).
        * The optional ``system_prompt`` is persisted at most ONCE per
          session — only on the first ``run()`` call for that session.
        * Tool roundtrips are NOT persisted to state; the loop's working
          list carries them. Audit-level tool provenance is BR-011's
          responsibility.
        * A Runner-level ``run_id`` is generated per ``run()`` call for
          log correlation and is SEPARATE from the inner :class:`AgentLoop`
          run id. Neither id is exposed on :class:`AgentEvent` values.

        Algorithm (full edge-case detail in the module docstring):

        1. Load prior messages from the state store.
        2. If the session is empty AND ``system_prompt`` is set, append the
           system message to state BEFORE the user message.
        3. Append the user message to state BEFORE driving the loop. This
           is the load-bearing transactional property — if the loop
           later fails the user message remains durable.
        4. Drive :meth:`AgentLoop.run` with the loaded-plus-user
           conversation. Forward every event to the caller unchanged.
        5. If the run terminates with a :class:`FinalEvent` and no
           preceding :class:`ErrorEvent`, append the assistant message
           to state. Otherwise skip — the fallback final answer is
           yielded but not committed.

        On consumer cancellation (the consumer breaks out of the
        ``async for`` loop): :class:`asyncio.CancelledError` propagates
        untouched. The user message persisted in step 3 survives; no
        assistant message is persisted.

        On :class:`agent_sdk.errors.StateStoreError` raised by the state
        store: the error is logged at ``ERROR`` and re-raised. The Runner
        does NOT swallow state-store failures — the caller decides retry
        policy.

        Args:
            session_id: Opaque session identifier.
            user_message: The new user message text.

        Yields:
            :class:`AgentEvent` values forwarded from the inner
            :class:`AgentLoop` in monotonic ``sequence`` order. The
            terminal event is always a :class:`FinalEvent`.

        Raises:
            agent_sdk.errors.StateStoreError: If any state-store
                operation fails. The error is logged before being
                re-raised.
            asyncio.CancelledError: Propagated untouched from the loop
                or from the consumer's cancellation.
