"""AgentRunner — the user-facing orchestrator.

:class:`AgentRunner` is the SDK's top-level entry point for running an
agent across multiple conversational turns. It wraps an
:class:`agent_sdk.loop.AgentLoop` with conversation-state persistence
around each ``run()`` call:

1. Load prior messages from a :class:`agent_sdk.state.protocol.StateStore`.
2. Persist any first-turn ``system_prompt`` and the user's new message
   BEFORE driving the loop (durable proof of request).
3. Drive :meth:`AgentLoop.run` and forward every
   :class:`agent_sdk.streaming.AgentEvent` to the caller.
4. Persist the assistant's final answer ONLY on a clean
   :class:`agent_sdk.streaming.FinalEvent` with no preceding
   :class:`agent_sdk.streaming.ErrorEvent`.

System prompt vs. AgentLoop's structured prompt
    :class:`AgentLoop`'s ``prompts: PromptSections`` is the SDK-structured
    prompt rebuilt on every iteration from a tool-registry snapshot. It is
    NEVER persisted — it lives inside the loop's private working list and
    is the model's per-iteration reasoning scaffolding.

    :class:`AgentRunner`'s ``system_prompt: str | None`` is an OPTIONAL
    consumer-supplied kickoff message that, when set, is persisted as
    the first :class:`agent_sdk.llm.types.ChatMessage` with
    ``role="system"`` on the FIRST turn of a session only. It is the
    high-level instruction the consumer wants to ride alongside the
    SDK's structured prompt (for example, "You are a helpful
    customer-support agent"). Both coexist in the loop's prompt; that
    is intentional and supported by every major LLM provider.

Transactional persistence invariants
    * Every successful ``run()`` appends exactly one user message and
      exactly one assistant message to the state store. If
      ``system_prompt`` was set and the session was empty, exactly one
      :class:`ChatMessage` with ``role="system"`` is also appended,
      BEFORE the user message.
    * On any error during loop execution (LLMError, ParserError,
      iteration cap), the assistant message is NOT persisted; the user
      message remains durable. The fallback final answer is yielded to
      the caller but not committed to history.
    * On consumer cancellation, the assistant message is NOT persisted;
      the user message remains durable.
    * Tool roundtrips (``role="tool"`` messages) are NOT persisted to the
      state store. They live in the loop's private working list and are
      deterministically re-derivable from the assistant's final answer
      on the next turn. Tool-level provenance is instead captured through
      the optional :class:`agent_sdk.audit.protocol.AuditSink` (see below).

Audit emission
    When an optional :class:`agent_sdk.audit.protocol.AuditSink` is wired
    in, the Runner emits an :class:`agent_sdk.audit.protocol.AuditEvent` at
    four points of every ``run()``: session start, each tool invocation
    (args plus a bounded result summary), the final answer, and any error.

    Audit emission is best-effort and isolated from the run: a raising
    sink is caught by :meth:`_emit_audit`, logged at ``WARNING`` under the
    ``agent_sdk.audit`` logger (event ``audit.emit_failed``), and
    swallowed — a sink outage NEVER aborts a live run.
    :class:`asyncio.CancelledError` is the one exception that is re-raised
    untouched. When ``audit`` is ``None`` (the default) emission is
    zero-overhead: :meth:`_emit_audit` returns before constructing any
    :class:`AuditEvent`.

Observability hooks
    When an optional :class:`agent_sdk.observability.Hooks` is wired in,
    the Runner fires five of the seven hooks: ``on_run_start`` once at run
    start, ``on_tool_start`` / ``on_tool_end`` per tool invocation,
    ``on_error`` on a loop or durability failure, and ``on_run_end`` once
    from the ``finally`` block on EVERY exit path. The remaining two hooks
    (``on_iteration``, ``on_llm_call``) are Loop-tier — the consumer must
    wire the SAME :class:`Hooks` instance into :class:`agent_sdk.loop.
    AgentLoop` as well. The Runner does NOT forward ``hooks`` into the loop;
    the two collaborators are wired independently, exactly like ``audit``.

    Hook dispatch is best-effort and isolated, mirroring audit emission: a
    raising hook is caught, logged at ``WARNING`` under the
    ``agent_sdk.observability`` logger (event ``hook.invoke_failed``), and
    swallowed — including ``on_run_end`` raising inside ``finally``, where
    the swallow guarantee is what makes awaiting a hook there safe.
    :class:`asyncio.CancelledError` is re-raised untouched. When ``hooks``
    is ``None`` (the default) dispatch is zero-overhead.

Logging
    Module-level :mod:`structlog` logger. ``INFO`` on run start and run
    end; ``ERROR`` only when persistence itself fails. Never logs prompt
    or message content — only lengths and counts.

    The ``runner.run_completed`` log carries ``terminated_by`` with one of:

    * ``"final_answer"`` — happy path: a clean :class:`FinalEvent` was
      yielded and the assistant message was persisted.
    * ``"error"`` — loop-internal failure (LLMError, ParserError,
      MaxIterationsExceeded). The loop's fallback FinalEvent is yielded
      but the assistant message is NOT persisted.
    * ``"state_store_error"`` — durability boundary failed. A
      :class:`agent_sdk.errors.StateStoreError` propagated out of one of
      the load/append calls. A companion ``phase`` field names which
      site failed: ``"load"``, ``"persist_system"``, ``"persist_user"``,
      or ``"persist_assistant"``.
    * ``"cancelled"`` — caller cancelled the consumer task or broke out
      of the ``async for`` via ``aclose()``.

            print(event)

    Args:
        loop: The :class:`AgentLoop` instance to drive on each ``run()``
            call. The same loop is reused across turns.
        state: Any :class:`StateStore` implementation. Use
            :class:`MemoryStateStore` for ephemeral in-memory storage;
            BR-009/BR-010 ship durable backends.
        system_prompt: Optional consumer-supplied kickoff persisted as the
            FIRST :class:`ChatMessage` with ``role="system"`` on the first
            turn of each fresh session. When ``None`` (default), no system
            message is persisted; the loop's structured prompt does the
            entire job. See the module docstring for the precise boundary
            between this and ``AgentLoop.prompts``.
        audit: Optional :class:`agent_sdk.audit.protocol.AuditSink`. When
            set, the Runner emits an
            :class:`agent_sdk.audit.protocol.AuditEvent` on session start,
            each tool invocation, the final answer, and any error. A
            raising sink never aborts a run — see the module docstring's
            "Audit emission" section. When ``None`` (default), emission is
            zero-overhead.
        hooks: Optional :class:`agent_sdk.observability.Hooks`. When set,
            the Runner fires the five Runner-tier hooks (``on_run_start``,
            ``on_run_end``, ``on_tool_start``, ``on_tool_end``,
            ``on_error``). The two Loop-tier hooks (``on_iteration``,

                loop = AgentLoop(..., hooks=hooks)
                runner = AgentRunner(loop=loop, state=..., hooks=hooks)

            A raising hook never aborts a run — see the module docstring's
            "Observability hooks" section. When ``None`` (default),
            dispatch is zero-overhead.

    Invariants:
        * Every ``run()`` either persists exactly one user message and
          exactly one assistant message, OR persists only the user
          message (on error or cancellation).
        * The optional ``system_prompt`` is persisted at most ONCE per
          session — only on the first ``run()`` call for that session.
        * Tool roundtrips are NOT persisted to state; the loop's working
          list carries them. Tool-level provenance is captured through the
          optional ``audit`` sink instead.
        * Audit emission is best-effort and isolated: a raising
          :class:`AuditSink` is caught and logged, never propagated. With
          ``audit=None`` the run behaves identically to a Runner built
          without auditing — no events, no overhead.
        * Observability hook dispatch is best-effort and isolated: a
          raising hook is caught and logged, never propagated. With
          ``hooks=None`` the run behaves identically to a Runner built
          without hooks — no dispatch, no overhead.
        * A Runner-level ``run_id`` is generated per ``run()`` call for
          log correlation and is SEPARATE from the inner :class:`AgentLoop`
          run id. Neither id is exposed on :class:`AgentEvent` values.
